				<div class="answer">
					<p>Segregation of concrete can occur in two forms. In the first, the coarser particles tend to separate out while concrete is conveyed along a slope (for e.g. sloped roof and staircase waist slab) or non-homogeneous coarse aggregates settle below leaving the slurry with fine aggregate above. The second form of segregation occurs in wet mixes by separation of grout from the mix. This happens due to excess vibration of the concrete and dropping it from a height.</p>

						<br/> Plastering Cracks: Plastering cracks appear because of evaporation of water, increased thickness, very fine sand, low quality bricks, non-uniform plastering, improper seasoning of walls, use of incorrect proportions in the mix, improper filling of joints, insufficient curing or excess free lime or Magnesium oxide.
						<br/>
						<br/> RCC cracks: RCC cracks due to insufficient reinforcement and cover, corroded steel, high slump, improper vibration, volume changes, excessive coarse aggregates, expansion of concrete, lack of sufficient quantity of cement, electrical conduits not placed at sufficient depth in the concrete.

				<div class="answer">
					<p>Curing of all exposed surfaces should be started as soon as possible after the concrete has set. This will depend on the type of cement, admixture used and prevailing weather conditions and is best decided based on a field inspection. It should be remembered that curing at the earliest is very important. It is difficult and expensive to alter or repair concrete once it is placed and set. Improperly cured concrete has been the one of the causes for early deterioration and reduced service life of concrete structures. Such concrete is porous and has reduced durability and strength. Hence, constant and strict supervision of curing is necessary during construction. The strength gained by concrete at the time of stripping of formwork should be adequate and this depends on how well the concrete is cured.</p>

						<li>Reduce the time between placing and start of curing by eliminating delays during construction.</li>
						<li>To minimize evaporation protect the concrete immediately after finishing with wet burlap, fog spray, or a curing compound.</li>
						<li>Strict adherence to specifications regarding evaporation rates and cessation of concrete placement if relative humidity is low and temperature and wind speeds are high.</li>
